### Our research

- Focusing on data-driven cancer research, combining high-throughput genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic profiling approaches, to comprehensively investigate molecular landscapes of GI cancer and identify prognosis/predictive biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets
- Functional study of identified candidate genes using patient derived tumor organoids, a new generation of *ex vivo* models.
- Pan-cancer study and in-depth data mining.



### Tools & Databases we developed

- [PINA](http://omics.bjcancer.org/pina): An integrated platform for protein interaction network construction, filtering, analysis, visualization and management
- [CVCDAP](http://omics.bjcancer.org/cvcdap): DIY Your Cancer Cohort & Omics-X Analysis



### IT infrastrucuter

- The center is equipped with a high-performance cluster computing system (760 CPU cores and 5.12 TB memory) and a high-speed (56Gb/s) storage network (1.44 PB) for analysis of large cohorts of -omics data.
