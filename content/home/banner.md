### Research interests

- Focus on data-driven cancer research, by utilizing high-throughput genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic approaches, to characterize
  molecular landscapes of gastrointestinal cancer for identifying clinical
  biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets.
- Develop software tools and databases for functional analysis (pathway and interaction network) , pan-cancer analysis etc.
- Investigate function and therapeutic potential of candidate genes
  identified from the discovery study, using patient derived tumor organoids and xenografts.



### Major Projects

- Genomic and Proteomic Characterisation of Gastric Cancer([GPGC](https://www.icgc-argo.org/page/101/gpgc)): an ICGC-ARGO project to investigate the proteogenomic landscape of gastric cancer from a clinically well-annotated cohort, and define molecular subtype and corresponding therapeutic implications. The developed multi-modal predictive signatures for chemo-response will be validated using samples collected from clinical trials.
- [CVCDAP](http://omics.bjcancer.org/cvcdap) : a web-based Cancer Virtual Cohort Discovery Analysis Platform to allow flexible selection of patients sharing common molecular/clinical characteristics integrated from different studies (>10,000 patients), and perform rapid and effective discovery analysis to answer versatile biological and clinical research questions using dozens of built-in tools.
- [PINA](http://omics.bjcancer.org/pina) is an integrated platform for protein interaction network
  construction, filtering, analysis, visualization and management. ([*Nucleic Acids Res* 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22067443)*,* [*Nature Methods* 2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19079255)*)*



### IT infrastructure

  Our center is equipped with a high-performance cluster computing system (760 CPU cores and 5.12 TB memory) and a high-speed (56Gb/s) storage network (1.44 PB) for storage and analysis of large -omics data.
