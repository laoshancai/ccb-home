Protein Interaction Network Analysis  [(PINA)](http://omics.bjcancer.org/pina/) platform is an integrated platform for protein interaction network construction, filtering, analysis, visualization and management. It integrates protein-protein interaction data from six public curated databases and builds a complete, non-redundant protein interaction dataset for six model organisms. Moreover, it provides a variety of built-in tools to filter, visualize and analyze interaction networks for gaining biological insights at network level.
