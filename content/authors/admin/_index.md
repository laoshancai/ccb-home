**Research Highlights**

<font size="4" >

- Performed pan-cancer analysis of the kinome, to gain insights into how members of the protein kinase superfamily are dysregulated in malignancy, the context-dependent functional role of specific kinases in cancer and how kinome remodelling modulates sensitivity to anticancer drugs. ([*Nature Reviews Cancer 2016*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26822576))

- Developed a number of integrated platforms for functional analysis, including PINA ([*Nucleic Acids Res* 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22067443)*,* [*Nature Methods* 2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19079255)*),* Weblab *(*[*Nucleic Acids Res. 2009*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19465388)*) and* KOBAS-web *(*[*Nucleic Acids Res. 2006* ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16845106)*)*
