**Our research**

- Focusing on data-driven cancer research, combining high-throughput genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic profiling approaches, to comprehensively investigate molecular landscapes of GI cancer and identify prognosis/predictive biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets
- Functional study of identified candidate genes using patient derived tumor organoids, a new generation of *ex vivo* models.
- Pan-cancer study and in-depth data mining.



**Tools & Databases we developed**

- [PINA](http://omics.bjcancer.org/pina): An integrated platform for protein interaction network construction, filtering, analysis, visualization and management
- [CVCDAP](http://omics.bjcancer.org/cvcdap): DIY Your Cancer Cohort & Omics-X Analysis
